The role of the **state** in various aspects of life whether it be **religion**,
family dynamics, or **art,** varies drastically throughout both time and
geographical regions. The influence of the **state** in Early Western art
extended into **religion** even from the earliest civilizations, creating a
single cohesive unit. With emphasis placed on **religion** in these early
civilizations being so prominent, the way in which rulers and
individuals came to represent their own culture nearly always included
some divine aspect. From the kingdoms of Sumer and Egypt, to Greece and
Rome, to Byzantium, the influence of the **state** and its **religion** is
evident in works of **art** due to the piece's subject matter, purpose, and
commissioner. Both buildings as well as statues and sarcophagi
prioritize representation of divine and **state** power over any stylistic
decisions of the specific artist. Thus, any influence the individual,
specifically the artist, has on a piece of **art** is overpowered by the
cultural impact of the **state** and its **religion** on the work.

Throughout the reign of the Egyptian Empire, the role of **religion** and
**state** dominated most aspects of people's lives. The leader of the **state**,
the pharaoh, was even believed to become a deity when he or she died.
The **Palette of Narmer** from Early Dynastic Egypt was a tool used to mix
and grind materials for makeup. On one side of the palette, Narmer is
depicted wearing the white crown of Upper Egypt about to crush the head
of a foe with the help of a falcon shown to his right, believed to be
the earthly form of the Sun God Horus. On the opposite side of the
palette is the head of the Goddess Harthor and Narmer wearing the Red
Crown of Lower Egypt. While the physical purpose of this piece is to
hold makeup, the stylistic elements are meant to convey a message of
authority through associating the King's power with that of the Gods. By
implementing this subject matter rather than merely an eye-pleasing
design, the influence of the **state** becomes evident.

In addition to the *Palette of Narmer* among Egyptian works of **art,** the
*Hypostyle Hall of Rameses II* in the Temple of Amun serves as another
example of the far-reaching influence of **religion**. The temple was built
in nineteenth dynasty and the Hypostyle Hall was designed around the
Creation Story of the Egyptians. The columns featured detailed pictorial
reliefs with swamp and lotus near the bottom of the columns and the sky
pictured above. This hall was built as a place &ldquo;where common people
extol the name of his majesty&rdquo; as referred to by Rameses II. In
creating a building with the subject being the creation story of the
practiced **religion** and a purpose of providing a place for people to
praise the Pharaoh reveals the connection between the **state** and **religion**
as well as its importance. The east-west orientation of the whole
temple, following the daily path of the sun, also points to religious
connotations. Additionally, Ramses II himself was the commissioner of
this building, showing the influence of the **state** over **art** in Egyptian
culture.

The Greeks, while differing from the Egyptians in prominent elements of
culture including **religion** and government structure, created artwork
that continued to embody the power of their gods and emperors more so
than the style of the individual artist. This pattern is seen in the
*Altar of Zeus*, which was erected during the Hellenistic Period of
Greece. The single-story ionic style temple had elaborate sculptures
carved into the frieze, which extended around the whole base of the
building. This frieze depicts the battle between the giants and the gods
which the Greeks viewed as similar to their own battle with all
outsiders to the Empire. The structure's purpose was to thank the deity
Zeus while also to commemorate the **state**'s victory over the Gauls. In
doing so, the subject matter supports this purpose and focuses on the
battle of the gods. The **state** and the divine are further connected
through the analogy of the gods and the giants with the Greeks and the
barbarians. Once again, the **state** and its **religion** are connected and
together form the central themes of the building.

The statue *Augustus of Primaporta* was created in the Early Imperial
Period of the Roman Empire. The piece shows Augustus as a Roman General
with his arm extended in a commanding pose. Cupid is riding a dolphin
near Augustus' right leg, referencing the claim that the emperor's
family is descent from the Goddess Venus. Additionally, his breastplate
depicts a scene of his diplomatic victory over the Parthians. While the
artist chose to idealize Augustus' body but show distinguishing
characteristics of his face, this effect is insignificant compared to
the subject matter and purpose of the work. The statue serves as
propaganda in support of Augustus by depicting diplomatic victory and
divine justification for his rule. Cupid symbolizes the support of the
gods. The inclusion of the detailed breastplate and Cupid contribute to
the overall effect of the piece more so than the stylistic choices of
the artist.

As the **religion** of the Roman **state** transitioned towards Christianity, so
too did the influences over various works of **art**.The Sarcophagi of
Junius Bassus was created during the Late Imperial/Early Christian
Period of the Roman Empire. The design is centered on the Christian
narrative, with each of the ten square sections depicting scenes from
the New and Old Testament. The middle scenes of each of the two levels
both depict Christ as a Roman emperor either resting his feet on Coelus,
the pagan God of the Heavens, or as a Roman Emperor entering the city of
Jerusalem. The surrounding eight sections on the outside of the
Sarcophagi depict scenes from the Christian narrative as well. This
particular piece most prominently exemplifies the impact of **religion** on
**art.** The whole sarcophagi is dedicated to portraying various scenes from
the Christian beliefs rather than anything that relates specifically to
Junius Bassus' life. The influence of **religion** carries over to every
aspect of the people's live even to death. The specific artistic choices
such as how to represent the people are less significant than the
overall theme itself.

After the reign of the Greeks and Romans in the western world, the
Empire of Byzantium became the dominant civilization of the area. The
connection between the emperor and the gods/goddesses of the **religion**
remains in the Byzantine works of Art. Specifically, the *Hagia Sophia*
was built by Emperor Justinian in an effort to build a church to convey
the imperial and Christian power. In order to do so, the huge central
dome was built to appear as if it is mysteriously floating due to the
use of gold mosaic, windows, and pendentives. The purpose of the
building was to prove to the people of Byzantium the power of Justinian
and his divine connections. While the unique design elements of the
building as a whole were decided by the architect's own preferences,
they contributed to the purpose and central meaning of the structure. The
power of the **state** and its connection to divine power. Each design
element decided by the architects were made to further the celestial
effect.

Ultimately, by examining various works of **art** throughout distinct time
periods and civilizations, the common pattern of the influence of the
**state** and its **religion** is more evident over the artist's individual
choices. The strategy of associating the power of the ruler, whether it
be a pharaoh or emperor, with the support of a higher power and
establishing this through **art** persists throughout civilizations. The
subject matter of pieces of **art,** the purpose, and the commissioner of
the work are all in some way influenced greatly by the **state** and its
**religion**. The effects of any individual stylistic choices made by the
artist are rendered obsolete in comparison. Throughout thousands of
years, this pattern of reliance on **religion** to give guidance in people's
lives remains and in doing so, extends into cultural aspects, especially
works of art.
